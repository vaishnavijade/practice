/*Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, where the i-th pile has piles[i] bananas. 
The guards have gone, and Koko can decide her own banana eating speed k (bananas per hour). 
Each hour, she chooses any pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. 
If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and does not eat any more bananas during that hour.

Koko likes to finish eating all the bananas within h hours. 

Your task is to find the minimum integer value of k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two integers n and h, where n is the number of piles and h is the maximum number of hours Koko has to eat all the bananas.
Line-2: n space-separated integers, representing the number of bananas in each pile.

Output Format:
--------------
Return the minimum eating speed k such that Koko can eat all the bananas within h hours.

Constraints:
------------
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ piles[i] ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ h ≤ 10^9


Sample Input-1:
---------------
4 8
3 6 7 11

Sample Output-1:
----------------
4

Explanation:
Koko can eat at a speed of k = 4 bananas per hour:
	In the first hour, she eats 3 bananas from pile 1 (completing the pile).
	In the second hour, she eats 4 bananas from pile 2, leaving 2 bananas.
	In the third hour, she eats the remaining 2 bananas from pile 2.
	In the fourth and fifth hours, she eats the pile 3 and 4. Total time: 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8 hours.

Sample Input-2:
---------------
5 7
30 11 23 4 20

Sample Output-2:
----------------
30

Explanation:
Koko can finish all bananas at a speed of k = 30. She eats each pile in an hour.


Sample Input-3:
---------------
5 6
30 11 23 4 20

Sample Output-3:
23

Explanation:
Koko can eat all bananas in 6 hours with a speed of k = 23. */
