/*We build a table of n rows (1-indexed). The table is generated based on the following rules:
	The first row (for n = 1) contains a single symbol 0.
	For each subsequent row n, every 0 in the previous row is replaced with 01, and every 1 is replaced with 10.

The problem is to return the k-th symbol (1-indexed) in the n-th row of the table.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer, represents n is the row number
Line-2: An integer, represents k is the position in the row

Output Format:
--------------
Line-1: Return either 0 or 1, representing the k-th symbol in the n-th row.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
1 //n
1 //k

Sample Output-1:
----------------
0

Sample Input-2:
---------------
2 //n
1 //k

Sample Output-2:
----------------
0

Explanation: 
row 1: 0
row 2: 01

Sample Input-3:
---------------
2 //n
2 //k

Sample Output-3:
----------------
1

Explanation: 
row 1: 0
row 2: 01


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 30
1 ≤ k ≤ 2^(n-1)

Explanation on approach:
The generation of the rows follows a pattern based on the previous row:
	For n = 1, the row is 0.
	For n = 2, replace 0 with 01: the row becomes 01.
	For n = 3, replace each 0 with 01 and each 1 with 10: the row becomes 0110.
	For n = 4, the row becomes 01101001.

To solve this problem recursively:
If k is less than or equal to half of the length of the previous row, the value is the same as in the previous row.
Otherwise, we apply a "NOT" operation to the value in the second half of the previous row. */
